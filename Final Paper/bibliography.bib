abstract = {TIM CROW as a state-established and state-maintained institution in Vir-ginia is a child of the twentieth century. The Old Dominion, like the other Southern states, entered the new century with an absence of rigid, caste-like segregation established and maintained by state law. Not until 1900 did Virginia enact her first statewide segregation law, while as late as 1944 it was still adding to the, by then, long list of such statutes. Ironically, the greatest number, and often the most far-reaching, of these statutes was enacted not in the period 1901-1917, which might well be called that of "the nadir," but rather in the 1920's and 1930's when Negroes at long last had entered upon the road which led to the Second Reconstruction. Yet, upon closer examination, that fact is not so ironi-cal. During the period of the nadir Negroes were no threat to white Vir-ginians; for most of their race had just been disfranchised by the new state constitution of 1902, while the first of the state segregation stat-utes, and even lynching, served to keep them in their "place." But by the twenties, and especially by the thirties, once again white Southern-ers knew that their world was changing, while many of its institutions were under attack both from within and without. Not only had some of the South's segregation statutes already fallen before the federal courts, but at home Southern Negroes were attacking the constitutionali-ty of white primaries, which had made the Democratic Party a kind of "white man's club," while nationally, that same Party increasingly was coming to reflect both the interests and the philosophy of Northern urban masses. Nor was there any longer a conservative Negro leader, Booker T. Washington, to counsel his people to "put down your buck-et where you are." At such times men's thoughts turned to means by which the status quo might best be preserved, and new race laws fol-lowed.},

abstract = {Background: To predict mortality risk in victims of violent crimes based on individual injury diagnoses and other information available in health care registries. Methods: Data from the Swedish hospital discharge registry and the cause of death registry were combined to identify 15,000 hospitalisations or prehospital deaths related to violent crimes. The ability of patient characteristics, injury type and severity, and cause of injury to predict death was modelled using conventional, Lasso, or Bayesian logistic regression in a development dataset and evaluated in a validation dataset. Results: Of 14,470 injury events severe enough to cause death or hospitalization 3.7{\%} (556) died before hospital admission and 0.5{\%} (71) during the hospital stay. The majority (76{\%}) of hospital survivors had minor injury severity and most (67{\%}) were discharged from hospital within 1 day. A multivariable model with age, sex, the ICD-10 based injury severity score (ICISS), cause of injury, and major injury region provided predictions with very good discrimination (C-index = 0.99) and calibration. Adding information on major injury interactions further improved model performance. Modeling individual injury diagnoses did not improve predictions over the combined ICISS score. Conclusions: Mortality risk after violent crimes can be accurately estimated using administrative data. The use of Bayesian regression models provides meaningful risk assessment with more straightforward interpretation of uncertainty of the prediction, potentially also on the individual level. This can aid estimation of incidence trends over time and comparisons of outcome of violent crimes for injury surveillance and in forensic medicine.},

However, how people perceive and interact with a visualization tool can strongly influence their understanding of the data as well as the system's usefulness. Human factors therefore contribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an important role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools. Several research initiatives have begun to explore human factors in visualization, particularly in perception-based design. Nonetheless, visualization work involving human factors is in its infancy, and many potentially promising areas have yet to be explored. Therefore, this paper aims to 1) review known methodology for doing human factors research, with specific emphasis on visualization, 2) review current human factors research in visualization to provide a basis for future investigation, and 3) identify promising areas for future research.},

abstract = {The problem of variable selection within the class of generalized additive models, when there are many covariates to choose from but the number of predictors is still somewhat smaller than the number of observations, is considered. Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we propose a modified bootstrap method, and show that it provides valid approximation to the distribution of the Lasso estimator, for all possible values of the unknown regression parameter vector, including the case where some of the components are zero. Further, we establish consistency of the modified bootstrap method for estimating the asymptotic bias and variance of the Lasso estimator. We also show that the residual bootstrap can be used to consistently estimate the distribution and variance of the adaptive Lasso estimator. Using the former result, we formulate a novel data-based method for choosing the optimal penalizing parameter for the Lasso using the modified bootstrap. A numerical study is performed to investigate the finite sample performance of the modified bootstrap. The methodology proposed in the article is illustrated with a real data example.},

The main contribution of the proposed approach lies in using aggregated and anonymized human behavioral data derived from mo- bile network activity to tackle the crime prediction problem. While previous research efforts have used either background historical knowledge or offenders' profiling, our findings sup- port the hypothesis that aggregated human behavioral data captured from the mobile network infrastructure, in combination with basic demographic information, can be used to predict crime. In our experimental results with real crime data from London we obtain an accuracy of almost 70{\%} when predicting whether a specific area in the city will be a crime hotspot or not. Moreover, we provide a discussion of the implications of our findings for data-driven crime analysis.},

abstract = {Understanding the causes of crime is a longstanding issue in researcher's agenda. While it is a hard task to extract causality from data, several linear models have been proposed to predict crime through the existing correlations between crime and urban metrics. However, because of non-Gaussian distributions and multicollinearity in urban indicators, it is common to find controversial conclusions about the influence of some urban indicators on crime. Machine learning ensemble-based algorithms can handle well such problems. Here, we use a random forest regressor to predict crime and quantify the influence of urban indicators on homicides. Our approach can have up to 97{\%} of accuracy on crime prediction, and the importance of urban indicators is ranked and clustered in groups of equal influence, which are robust under slightly changes in the data sample analyzed. Our results determine the rank of importance of urban indicators to predict crime, unveiling that unemployment and illiteracy are the most important variables for describing homicides in Brazilian cities. We further believe that our approach helps in producing more robust conclusions regarding the effects of urban indicators on crime, having potential applications for guiding public policies for crime control. Highlights • Predictive analysis is applied to crime data; • Correlation between crime and urban metrics; • Quantification of the importance of urban metrics in predicting crime.},

abstract = {The pattern of zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix of a multivari-ate normal distribution corresponds to conditional independence restrictions between variables. Covariance selection aims at estimating those structural zeros from data. We show that neighborhood selection with the Lasso is a computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance selection for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Neighborhood selection estimates the conditional independence restrictions separately for each node in the graph and is hence equivalent to variable selection for Gaussian linear models. We show that the proposed neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Consistency hinges on the choice of the penalty parameter. The oracle value for optimal prediction does not lead to a consistent neighborhood estimate. Controlling instead the probability of falsely joining some distinct connectivity components of the graph, consistent estimation for sparse graphs is achieved (with exponential rates), even when the number of variables grows as the number of observations raised to an arbitrary power.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

We employ feature selection techniques to investigate the power of different features derived from Foursquare check-ins in predicting crime counts in New York over a period of 5 years. Our study shows that the number of venues (as a metric of neighborhood popularity) and the venues entropy (as a metric of neighborhood diversity) are the most discrim-inative features when considering all incidents. The number of users and their interactions with the venues in form of check-ins in specific types of venues (as proxies for the functional decomposition of the neighborhood) become relevant for certain types of incidents.},

It was much easier at that time to get driving directions from popular online mapping services, and I realized this was probably encouraging car usage over public transit. In my role at TriMet, I worked with transit data every day, so I knew such data was available and the potential was there. We offered our own online transit trip planning tool, as many agencies do. The trouble was, the average citizen often didn't know where to go to find this in- formation, especially if he or she was unfamiliar with the local transit system. The general public was used to going to certain online desti- nations for driving directions—Google Maps, MapQuest, and Yahoo were all widely used at the time—but the data they needed to plan a trip using public transit wasn't available where they were looking.

@article{Shjarback2017,
abstract = {Purpose This study explored whether police departments have engaged in “de-policing”—withdrawal from active police work—in response to unprecedented levels of negative attention, as well as the correlates of changes in police behavior. Methods Using data from 118 of the 121 police departments serving jurisdictions over 5000 residents in Missouri, we examined changes in both the quantity (rates of vehicle/traffic stops, searches, and arrests) and quality (“hit rates” from searches) of policing from 2014 to 2015 and whether de-policing corresponded with year-over-year changes in crime rates. Results The findings revealed a− 0.11 standardized change in stops (around 67,000 fewer stops in 2015 than 2014) and a 0.17 standardized change in hit rates (nearly 2 percentage points). Multivariate models indicated that departments serving larger African-American populations conducted fewer stops ($\beta$ = −0.44), searches ($\beta$=−0.37), and arrests ($\beta$=−0.27) in 2015 compared to 2014, although race was unrelated to changes in hit rates. Changes in police behavior had no appreciable effect on total, violent, or property crime rates. Conclusions The negative attention and increased scrutiny of law enforcement appears to have had an impact on traffic stops and hit rates in Missouri. Given the racialized findings, training and community-outreach programs should aim to increase mutual trust among the police and African-American communities. Also, increasing organizational justice within departments might be one way to improve officer morale and increase motivation in the current policing climate.},

abstract = {Under 42 U.S.C. {\S} 1983, individuals may sue those who violate their constitutional rights while acting under color of state law. The Supreme Court has held that private actors may act under color of state law, and may be sued under {\S} 1983 in some circumstances. However, courts have not been consistent in determining whether private university police forces act under color of state law. Private universities often maintain police forces that are given extensive police powers by state statutes but are controlled by private entities. Some courts have looked directly to the state statutes that delegate police power, but others have maintained a more fact-specific inquiry. The state enabling statutes themselves vary in their terms, but not their effects, and are thus partially responsible for this inconsistency. This Note proposes a model statute framework for delegating powers to private university police forces. Such a framework would better allow courts to apply the {\S} 1983 color of law test consistently. A model statute would also clarify the role of campus police forces and would require minimal change in the operation of private campus police forces. The resulting consistency would ensure that no citizen is deprived of a remedy for a violation of constitutional rights.},

abstract = {D uring the 2011-12 school year, about two-thirds (68{\%}) of the more than 900 U.S. 4-year colleges and universities with 2,500 or more students used sworn police officers to provide law enforcement services on campus (figure 1). Sworn police officers have full arrest powers granted by a state or local authority. The percentage of public institutions (92{\%}) using sworn officers was more than twice that of private institutions (38{\%}). Similar to sworn officers, about two-thirds of campuses were served by armed officers. The percentage of public campuses (91{\%}) using armed officers was also more than double the percentage of private institutions (36{\%}). Among public institutions, nearly all students were enrolled on campuses with sworn (96{\%}) and armed (94{\%}) officers. Among private institutions, nearly half of the students were enrolled on campuses with sworn (46{\%}) and armed (45{\%}) officers. These findings come from the 2011-12 Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies, the first conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) since the 2004-05 school year. Among the institutions contacted for both the 2004-05 and 2011-12 BJS surveys, the percentage using sworn officers increased from 75{\%} to 77{\%}, and the percentage using armed officers increased from 68{\%} to 75{\%} (not shown). },

@article{Sklansky2011,
abstract = {Very little of the expanding debate over private policing has employed the language of human rights. This is notable not just because private policing is a distinctly global phenomenon, and hu-man rights have become, as Michael Ignatieff puts it, " the lingua franca of global moral thought. " It is notable as well because a parallel development that seems in many ways related to the spread of private policing—the escalating importance of private military companies—has been debated as a matter of human rights. This Article asks whether discussions of private policing have been impoverished by their failure to employ the language of human rights. It begins by discussing the dramatic rise, over the past several decades, in the size and significance of private policing. It then summarizes the academic and public policy debates about that development and considers what, if anything, the language of human rights could add to those debates, and whether the addition would be welcome. One strand of the Article compares the debate over private policing with the debate over private military com-panies. Another strand compares private policing with private prisons, in light of the recent ruling by the Supreme Court of Israel declaring private prisons unconstitutional. The Article concludes that the benefits of introducing the language of human rights into debates about private policing are far from clear—with one exception. Human rights, particularly as codified in international treaties, do seem a promising way to get traction on a particular aspect of police privatization that has received less attention than it deserves: the way in which widespread reliance on private se-curity firms may weaken public commitment to providing everyone with a minimally acceptable degree of protection against private violence.},

abstract = {Legal scholars have largely neglected private policing, and the neglect is increasingly indefensible. The private security industry already employs more guards, patrol personnel, and detectives than the federal, state, and local governments combined, and the disparity is growing; to a striking extent, private firms now perform many of the beat-patrol tasks once thought central to the mission of the public police. In this Article, Professor David Sklansky describes what is known and unknown about the private security industry, traces the industry's history, assesses the challenges and opportunities it creates for judges and scholars, and provides an agenda for future research and doctrinal development. Private security firms furnish tangible evidence about what some people want but are not receiving from public law enforcement, and the legal regime governing private security - deconstitutionalized, defederalized, tort based, and heavily reliant both on legislatures and on juries - offers important opportunities to test some of the most persistent proposals for reforming criminal procedure law. In addition, because maintaining order and controlling crime are paradigmatic governmental functions, private policing presents a unique and underused vantage point for reexamining the public-private distinction and the state action doctrine. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, police privatization provides occasion for reconsidering the focus of constitutional law on negative obligations of government, and the focus of constitutional criminal procedure on fairness to individual criminal defendants; the dramatic spread of policing-for-hire should prompt us to rethink what it means to guarantee all citizens, regardless of wealth, the equal protection of the laws.},

abstract = {What do Disneyland, the Abu Ghraib U.S. military prison, the Mall of America, and the Y-12 nuclear security complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee have in common? They have wildly different purposes, but they share a common characteristic as employers of private police. This answer--indicative of the prevalence and numbers of private police today--would have struck the nineteenth-century observer as evidence of a gross failure by the state. Yet that reaction, in turn, would seem odd to us. Vocal support of private police can be found among public police chiefs, lawmakers, and even President Bush. What kinds of criticisms were once leveled at private police by public officials? How did one attitude, deeply skeptical of private police, evolve into another that sees heavy reliance upon private policing as beneficial, or at least benign? Here, I take a fresh look at the dynamics of that change, and by doing so, restore to their proper place fundamental questions about the use of police who are privately financed and organized in a democratic society. These questions, and the violent history that midwived them, have been largely and undeservedly forgotten by the legal literature. Using this historical perspective, I examine the shifting status of private policing: first, by examining the history of public criticism directed against them; second, by recounting the partnership model that first gained a foothold in studies sponsored by the federal government in the 1970s and 1980s; and third, by questioning the meaning and intentions behind the idea of partnership advanced today.},

Chapter III emphasizes in tabular form the state statutes from which the campus security officer derives his authority as well as the court cases and attorney general opinions interpreting these statutes. Chapter IV, by use of a questionnaire to the campus security directors, examines personnel
characteristics, the availability and use of specialized training and equipment, the relationships with other components on campus and the security force liaison with off-campus police. Chapter V, by utilizing an appraisal and role perception instrument, enables the campus security director, the faculty, the students and the

Planning scholars' understanding of the police usually focuses on the police violently removing people from urban space, yet critical criminology literature shows their function to be more diverse. I employ an exploratory case study, centered in the South Side of Chicago, to develop propositions to guide emergent research that centralizes the police within planning. The propositions (1) impel further investigation into how police not only exclude people but also define who belongs and (2) draw attention to how planning institutions can create new forms of police.},

abstract = {Although campus police have existed in various forms since the turn of the century, police researchers have neglected any in-depth study of this form of policing. Instead, the writings and practical ob- servations of campus law enforcers have dominated the campus police literature. Bordner and Petersen (1983) explain this apparent lack of interest in the campus police as the product of three major factors: (1) The campus protest literature of the 1960s and 1970s virtually ignored the role of campus police in quelling student unrest (e.g., Dynes, 1972; Flicker, 1969; Holmes, 1969; Stark, 1974); (2) The fact that, histori- cally, campus police have been little more than custodians (Kassinger, 1971); and (3) The fact that modem campus police did not originate until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Gelber, 1972). This paper presents the results of a pilot study of campus police at ten large universities located in the Midwest and the Southeast. The paper begins with a historical analysis of the evolution of the campus police, reviews the scholarly literature on the campus police, and pre- sents the highlights of a descriptive analysis of a sample of campus po- lice departments and officers. Finally, the striking similarities between campus police and their municipal counterparts will be discussed},

Little is known, however, regarding the attitudinal dispositions of these officers, specifically their acceptance of rape myths and the effect this has on case processing. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by examining attitudes toward and perceptions of sexual assault among a sample of campus law enforcement officers in Texas. This was done through the administration of a short survey to a sample of campus law enforcement officers prior to their attendance at a sexual assault-focused training, as well as all campus police chiefs via the Internet. Survey items inquired about officers' careers in law enforcement, contact with victims, and perceptions of sexual assault. Results suggest that officers' adherence to rape myths is strongly related to their perceptions of campus sexual assault incidents and their attitudes toward victims. Suggestions for future research and policy are offered.},

abstract = {Purpose: The literature on campus police (CP) is not as developed as mainstream or municipal police (MP). While there are several studies discussing the perception of CP, there are, however, no empirical studies investigating the perception of CP based on their legitimacy. Through the theoretical framework of liminality, this paper aims to address the literature gap by examining the perceived legitimacy of CP compared to MP. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through the use of survey instruments distributed among 593 college undergraduates at a doctoral extensive land grant institution in the Pacific Northwest. Since the purpose of the study was to determine student perceptions of legitimacy between MP and CP, two surveys were utilized to capture those perceptions, one for each police group respectively. The two sets of surveys were equally administered in each selected class. Findings: Through the framework of liminality, this research demonstrates the marginalization of CP as sworn law enforcement officers, especially when compared to their MP counterparts. Research limitations/implications: As this is the first study addressing the perceived legitimacy of the CP there needs to be further research in this area before substantial conclusions can be reached. Future research in this area should address the opinions of minority students, faculty and staff. Additionally, CP and MP officers themselves should be assessed to determine any potential legitimacy concerns based on perception. Originality/value: The theoretical framework reveals that the CP are trapped in a liminal state and are unable to transition into perceived legitimate police officers. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {To tackle this challenge, the book points to the lack of consideration of institutional and ideational contexts that, in this case, undermine the success of education and other efforts to promote human rights protections.3 Failure to take into account the local and specific contexts in which officers work leaves little room for researchers and teachers to develop ways to influence the adoption of such violence.4 Wahl conducted 119 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with eighty-three people, including law enforcement officers, human rights activists and educators, police reform experts, the National Human Rights Commission officials, and several experts from the Bureau of Police Research and Development in New Delhi.5 One of the key findings emerging from these interviews is that the vast majority of these police officers consider torture integral to the preservation of a just society. "15 To guard against the presumption of homogeneity in the broader context, it is important to recognize the position of those Indians who maintain a skeptical attitude toward police authority. [...]the lack of clarity of the definition of social justice might open the door to charges of normative cultural relativism, which is clearly contrary to this volume's main thrust. In India, this tension is exacerbated by laws that limit the ability of civilians to contest public officials in court, along with corruption in the legal and political systems.26 Examining the moral self-conception of the police in relation to the ongoing use of torture or other forms of extrajudicial violence makes Wahl's book required reading for a broad swath of social scientists and anthropologists, as well as for human rights NGOs and activists. If the policing culture in India is to gradually grow in tandem with modern human rights standards, activists and educators must attempt to understand and communicate with police officers and yet at the same time provide a crucial external check on the latter's behavior in contexts where the state falls short of fulfilling this function.31 Wahl's book is a systematic attempt to advance social justice and human rights in India by demonstrating how the police view torture and how they respond to efforts to prevent this form of violence.},

While several studies offer some evidence for the hypothesis, no study has yet tested the most direct spatial implication of this hypothesis within cities: that areas of a city undergoing gentrification or revitalization will evince higher levels of postindustrial policing. In a series of spatial Durbin models that utilize newly available data sets from New York City, this article demonstrates a strong positive association between gentrification and postindustrial policing. The article also finds that citizen demand for postindustrial policing is only weakly associated with its spatial distribution. These results and their potential implications are discussed in the conclusion.},

@article{Najdowski2015,
abstract = {We conducted 2 studies to investigate how cultural stereotypes that depict Blacks as criminals affect the way Blacks experience encounters with police officers, expecting that such encounters induce Blacks to feel stereotype threat (i.e., concern about being judged and treated unfairly by police because of the stereotype). In Study 1, we asked Black and White participants to report how they feel when interacting with police officers in general. As predicted, Blacks, but not Whites, reported concern that police officers stereotype them as criminals simply because of their race. In addition, this effect was found for Black men but not Black women. In Study 2, we asked Black and White men to imagine a specific police encounter and assessed potential downstream consequences of stereotype threat. Consistent with Study 1, Black but not White men anticipated feeling stereotype threat in the hypothetical police encounter. Further, racial differences in anticipated threat translated into racial differences in anticipated anxiety, self-regulatory efforts, and behavior that is commonly perceived as suspicious by police officers. By demonstrating that Blacks might expect to be judged and treated unfairly by police because of the negative stereotype of Black criminality, this research extends stereotype threat theory to the new domain of criminal justice encounters. It also has practical implications for understanding how the stereotype could ironically contribute to bias-based policing and racial disparities in the justice system.},

Sworn police officers have full arrest powers granted by a state or local authority. The percentage of public institutions (92{\%}) using sworn officers was more than twice that of private institutions (38{\%}). Similar to sworn officers, about two-thirds of campuses were served by armed officers. The percentage of public campuses (91{\%}) using armed officers was also more than double the percentage of private institutions (36{\%}). Among public institutions, nearly all students were enrolled on campuses with sworn (96{\%}) and armed (94{\%}) officers. Among private institutions, nearly half of the students were enrolled on campuses with sworn (46{\%}) and armed (45{\%}) officers. These findings come from the 2011–12 Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies, the first conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) since the 2004–05 school year.

A case analysis of the Chicago Police Department's (CPD) Citizen ICAM (Information Collection for Automated Mapping) is reviewed to determine the effects of feedback and the technology on the organization. We found that virtual interactivity is a complex process - more complex than typically described - that has significant effects on the structure and work processes of the CPD.

@article{Hetey2014,
abstract = {During the past few decades, punitive crime policies have led to explosive growth in the United States prison population. Such policies have contributed to unprecedented incarceration rates for Blacks in particular. In this article, we consider an unexamined relationship between racial disparities and policy reform. Rather than treating racial disparities as an outcome to be measured, we exposed people to real and extreme racial disparities and observed how this drove their support for harsh criminal-justice policies. In two experiments, we manipulated the racial composition of prisons: When the penal institution was represented as “more Black,” people were more concerned about crime and expressed greater acceptance of punitive policies than when the penal institution was represented as “less Black.” Exposure to extreme racial disparities, then, can lead people to support the very policies that produce those disparities, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle.},

@article{Ikegami2009,
abstract = {In this chapter, I would like to shed new light on the social consequences of military involvement from an insufficiently explored perspective — namely, the impact of waging war on the transformation of possessiveness in social relationships. Conceptualizing the influence of wars as a bridge between a theory of state formation and a theory of property relationships, I start my discussion by redefining the notion of property sociologically as a nexus of social relationships rather than a thing “out-there.” I argue that the waging of wars often decisively influenced the style of capitalism in a society. After presenting my theoretical argument on property as the embodiment of social relationships, I examine a case from Japanese history in which the historical experiences of preparing for and engaging in three wars have changed “property relationships.” This historical process of changing property relationships, I believe, shaped a distinctive style of capitalism in Japan.Wars are projects that require the most forceful mobilization of human capacities and material resources. The preparation for and prosecution of war frequently restrict or override individuals' control over their possessive resources. War redistributes goods and services and reorganizes the flow of material resources for military purposes in ways that affect existing property relationships. The outcome of a war — victory, defeat, or stalemate — may also bring about the reorganization of property relationships and may redefine new categories of property rights.},

The Fayyad government in the West Bank largely relies on financial and training support from the West, while the Hamas-ruled Gaza, lacking significant outside help, has been forced to streamline its operations. $\backslash$nAlthough well-intentioned, Western efforts have hindered—rather than helped—West Bank forces, who have received almost {\$}450 million in assistance from the United States and the European Union since 2007. The West's limited focus on technical rather than political assistance and disjointed overall approach—along with the lack of coherence and autonomy in the West Bank PASF—are largely responsible for the sector's failure to develop its own training and planning capabilities.},

@article{Williams2016,
abstract = {Campus safety and security is a salient issue and an area of increasing concern facing educational institutions in the United States. Yet little is known regarding ongoing efforts and resulting difficulties to co-produce campus safety and security. This article contributes to the literature on co-production by examining student and campus police officer perceptions of the professional–service user relationship in the context of campus safety and security. Findings suggest that demographic and contextual factors shape user and professional perceptions of their relationship in different ways, and that these perceptual differences affect efforts to co-deliver services. Points for practitioners: This article describes the views of university police personnel and students regarding the co-production of safety and security on a research university campus in the United States. Data gleaned from the research illustrates that while police officers and students may have differing views of one another and their roles in co-production, they agree that public safety would be served by opportunities for police and students to meet one another and have personal interaction outside of formal, law enforcement-driven situations. This suggests the value of well-developed engagement strategies, as well as the potential benefit of harnessing ‘teachable moments' during which police and the student population can learn about one another.},
