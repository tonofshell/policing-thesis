abstract = {This study identifies and describes legal and operational structures of campus security offices, obtains an appraisal of campus security offices by students, faculty, and administrators and develops a proposed model for the effective use of campus security officers within a college setting. Following an overview of the study, Chapter II traces the history of the early beginnings when the tasks of the security officer were the responsibility of many individuals of both high and low order. The chapter describes the events to date which brought about the formalizing of the campus security directors. Chapter III emphasizes in tabular form the state statutes from which the campus security officer derives his authority as well as the court cases and attorney general opinions interpreting these statutes. Chapter IV, by use of a questionnaire to the campus security directors, examines personnel
characteristics, the availability and use of specialized training and equipment, the relationships with other components on campus and the security force liaison with off-campus police. Chapter V, by utilizing an appraisal and role perception instrument, enables the campus security director, the faculty, the students and the
administrators to appraise the conduct and to estimate the needs of the security force. Chapter VI summarizes the available data and offers a model security force suited for the performance of major control functions not inconsistent with a supportive, integrated relationship with students; },

Reigning conceptions of relations between public police and private policing have changed markedly. A state-centered view of police functions disparaged 'private armies' and saw order maintenance as a quintessential function of government. In recent decades, a laissez-faire view has emerged that celebrates 'private-public partnerships' and sees private policing as an industry providing both a service and a public benefit.

@article{Sloan1992,
abstract = {Although campus police have existed in various forms since the turn of the century, police researchers have neglected any in-depth study of this form of policing. Instead, the writings and practical ob- servations of campus law enforcers have dominated the campus police literature. Bordner and Petersen (1983) explain this apparent lack of interest in the campus police as the product of three major factors: (1) The campus protest literature of the 1960s and 1970s virtually ignored the role of campus police in quelling student unrest (e.g., Dynes, 1972; Flicker, 1969; Holmes, 1969; Stark, 1974); (2) The fact that, histori- cally, campus police have been little more than custodians (Kassinger, 1971); and (3) The fact that modem campus police did not originate until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Gelber, 1972). This paper presents the results of a pilot study of campus police at ten large universities located in the Midwest and the Southeast. The paper begins with a historical analysis of the evolution of the campus police, reviews the scholarly literature on the campus police, and pre- sents the highlights of a descriptive analysis of a sample of campus po- lice departments and officers. Finally, the striking similarities between campus police and their municipal counterparts will be discussed},

Little is known, however, regarding the attitudinal dispositions of these officers, specifically their acceptance of rape myths and the effect this has on case processing. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by examining attitudes toward and perceptions of sexual assault among a sample of campus law enforcement officers in Texas. This was done through the administration of a short survey to a sample of campus law enforcement officers prior to their attendance at a sexual assault-focused training, as well as all campus police chiefs via the Internet. Survey items inquired about officers' careers in law enforcement, contact with victims, and perceptions of sexual assault. Results suggest that officers' adherence to rape myths is strongly related to their perceptions of campus sexual assault incidents and their attitudes toward victims. Suggestions for future research and policy are offered.},

@article{Wada2010,
abstract = {Purpose: The literature on campus police (CP) is not as developed as mainstream or municipal police (MP). While there are several studies discussing the perception of CP, there are, however, no empirical studies investigating the perception of CP based on their legitimacy. Through the theoretical framework of liminality, this paper aims to address the literature gap by examining the perceived legitimacy of CP compared to MP. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through the use of survey instruments distributed among 593 college undergraduates at a doctoral extensive land grant institution in the Pacific Northwest. Since the purpose of the study was to determine student perceptions of legitimacy between MP and CP, two surveys were utilized to capture those perceptions, one for each police group respectively. The two sets of surveys were equally administered in each selected class. Findings: Through the framework of liminality, this research demonstrates the marginalization of CP as sworn law enforcement officers, especially when compared to their MP counterparts. Research limitations/implications: As this is the first study addressing the perceived legitimacy of the CP there needs to be further research in this area before substantial conclusions can be reached. Future research in this area should address the opinions of minority students, faculty and staff. Additionally, CP and MP officers themselves should be assessed to determine any potential legitimacy concerns based on perception. Originality/value: The theoretical framework reveals that the CP are trapped in a liminal state and are unable to transition into perceived legitimate police officers. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {To tackle this challenge, the book points to the lack of consideration of institutional and ideational contexts that, in this case, undermine the success of education and other efforts to promote human rights protections.3 Failure to take into account the local and specific contexts in which officers work leaves little room for researchers and teachers to develop ways to influence the adoption of such violence.4 Wahl conducted 119 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with eighty-three people, including law enforcement officers, human rights activists and educators, police reform experts, the National Human Rights Commission officials, and several experts from the Bureau of Police Research and Development in New Delhi.5 One of the key findings emerging from these interviews is that the vast majority of these police officers consider torture integral to the preservation of a just society. "15 To guard against the presumption of homogeneity in the broader context, it is important to recognize the position of those Indians who maintain a skeptical attitude toward police authority. [...]the lack of clarity of the definition of social justice might open the door to charges of normative cultural relativism, which is clearly contrary to this volume's main thrust. In India, this tension is exacerbated by laws that limit the ability of civilians to contest public officials in court, along with corruption in the legal and political systems.26 Examining the moral self-conception of the police in relation to the ongoing use of torture or other forms of extrajudicial violence makes Wahl's book required reading for a broad swath of social scientists and anthropologists, as well as for human rights NGOs and activists. If the policing culture in India is to gradually grow in tandem with modern human rights standards, activists and educators must attempt to understand and communicate with police officers and yet at the same time provide a crucial external check on the latter's behavior in contexts where the state falls short of fulfilling this function.31 Wahl's book is a systematic attempt to advance social justice and human rights in India by demonstrating how the police view torture and how they respond to efforts to prevent this form of violence.},

While several studies offer some evidence for the hypothesis, no study has yet tested the most direct spatial implication of this hypothesis within cities: that areas of a city undergoing gentrification or revitalization will evince higher levels of postindustrial policing. In a series of spatial Durbin models that utilize newly available data sets from New York City, this article demonstrates a strong positive association between gentrification and postindustrial policing. The article also finds that citizen demand for postindustrial policing is only weakly associated with its spatial distribution. These results and their potential implications are discussed in the conclusion.},

@article{Najdowski2015,
abstract = {We conducted 2 studies to investigate how cultural stereotypes that depict Blacks as criminals affect the way Blacks experience encounters with police officers, expecting that such encounters induce Blacks to feel stereotype threat (i.e., concern about being judged and treated unfairly by police because of the stereotype). In Study 1, we asked Black and White participants to report how they feel when interacting with police officers in general. As predicted, Blacks, but not Whites, reported concern that police officers stereotype them as criminals simply because of their race. In addition, this effect was found for Black men but not Black women. In Study 2, we asked Black and White men to imagine a specific police encounter and assessed potential downstream consequences of stereotype threat. Consistent with Study 1, Black but not White men anticipated feeling stereotype threat in the hypothetical police encounter. Further, racial differences in anticipated threat translated into racial differences in anticipated anxiety, self-regulatory efforts, and behavior that is commonly perceived as suspicious by police officers. By demonstrating that Blacks might expect to be judged and treated unfairly by police because of the negative stereotype of Black criminality, this research extends stereotype threat theory to the new domain of criminal justice encounters. It also has practical implications for understanding how the stereotype could ironically contribute to bias-based policing and racial disparities in the justice system.},

abstract = {D uring the 2011–12 school year, about two-thirds (68{\%}) of the more than 900 U.S. 4-year colleges and universities with 2,500 or more students used sworn police officers to provide law enforcement services on campus (figure 1). Sworn police officers have full arrest powers granted by a state or local authority. The percentage of public institutions (92{\%}) using sworn officers was more than twice that of private institutions (38{\%}). Similar to sworn officers, about two-thirds of campuses were served by armed officers. The percentage of public campuses (91{\%}) using armed officers was also more than double the percentage of private institutions (36{\%}). Among public institutions, nearly all students were enrolled on campuses with sworn (96{\%}) and armed (94{\%}) officers. Among private institutions, nearly half of the students were enrolled on campuses with sworn (46{\%}) and armed (45{\%}) officers. These findings come from the 2011–12 Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies, the first conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) since the 2004–05 school year. Among the institutions contacted for both the 2004–05 and 2011–12 BJS surveys, the percentage using sworn officers increased from 75{\%} to 77{\%}, and the percentage using armed officers increased from 68{\%} to 75{\%} (not shown).},

abstract = {Considers the current efforts to describe the effect of Internet-based technology on interactivity between citizens and public organizations to be incomplete and poorly linked. This paper develops a model of interactivity that reflects the self-organization potential of virtual communication and the social context within which citizens and bureaucrats operate. The model helps us to identify ways in which different levels of feedback communication, e.g. e-mail, may affect both changes in organizations and communities, and the relationship between organizations and communities. A case analysis of the Chicago Police Department's (CPD) Citizen ICAM (Information Collection for Automated Mapping) is reviewed to determine the effects of feedback and the technology on the organization. We found that virtual interactivity is a complex process - more complex than typically described - that has significant effects on the structure and work processes of the CPD. We conclude by proposing a staged model of citizen-government interactivity and by identifying future research topics.},

CLEs are thought ideal for community policing, a strategy requiring organizational change, yet little research exists on CLE organizations or their use of community policing. This study examines community policing within CLEs and how it impacts organizational structures. The data were gathered in a national BJS survey of CLEs. Results indicated that community policing was only significantly related to formalization. Contrary to community policing mandates, community policing was related to more written policies. Implications and future research are discussed.},

The current study examines the relationship between a privately funded university police force and crime in a large US city. Following an expansion of the jurisdictional boundary of the private police force, we see no short-term change in crime. However, using a geographic regression discontinuity approach, we find large impacts of private police on public safety, with violent crime in particular decreasing. These contradictory results appear to be a consequence of a delayed effect of private police on crime.},

abstract = {During the past few decades, punitive crime policies have led to explosive growth in the United States prison population. Such policies have contributed to unprecedented incarceration rates for Blacks in particular. In this article, we consider an unexamined relationship between racial disparities and policy reform. Rather than treating racial disparities as an outcome to be measured, we exposed people to real and extreme racial disparities and observed how this drove their support for harsh criminal-justice policies. In two experiments, we manipulated the racial composition of prisons: When the penal institution was represented as “more Black,” people were more concerned about crime and expressed greater acceptance of punitive policies than when the penal institution was represented as “less Black.” Exposure to extreme racial disparities, then, can lead people to support the very policies that produce those disparities, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle.},

@article{Ikegami2009,
abstract = {In this chapter, I would like to shed new light on the social consequences of military involvement from an insufficiently explored perspective — namely, the impact of waging war on the transformation of possessiveness in social relationships. Conceptualizing the influence of wars as a bridge between a theory of state formation and a theory of property relationships, I start my discussion by redefining the notion of property sociologically as a nexus of social relationships rather than a thing “out-there.” I argue that the waging of wars often decisively influenced the style of capitalism in a society. After presenting my theoretical argument on property as the embodiment of social relationships, I examine a case from Japanese history in which the historical experiences of preparing for and engaging in three wars have changed “property relationships.” This historical process of changing property relationships, I believe, shaped a distinctive style of capitalism in Japan.Wars are projects that require the most forceful mobilization of human capacities and material resources. The preparation for and prosecution of war frequently restrict or override individuals' control over their possessive resources. War redistributes goods and services and reorganizes the flow of material resources for military purposes in ways that affect existing property relationships. The outcome of a war — victory, defeat, or stalemate — may also bring about the reorganization of property relationships and may redefine new categories of property rights.},

@article{Williams2016,
abstract = {Campus safety and security is a salient issue and an area of increasing concern facing educational institutions in the United States. Yet little is known regarding ongoing efforts and resulting difficulties to co-produce campus safety and security. This article contributes to the literature on co-production by examining student and campus police officer perceptions of the professional–service user relationship in the context of campus safety and security. Findings suggest that demographic and contextual factors shape user and professional perceptions of their relationship in different ways, and that these perceptual differences affect efforts to co-deliver services. Points for practitioners: This article describes the views of university police personnel and students regarding the co-production of safety and security on a research university campus in the United States. Data gleaned from the research illustrates that while police officers and students may have differing views of one another and their roles in co-production, they agree that public safety would be served by opportunities for police and students to meet one another and have personal interaction outside of formal, law enforcement-driven situations. This suggests the value of well-developed engagement strategies, as well as the potential benefit of harnessing ‘teachable moments' during which police and the student population can learn about one another.},
