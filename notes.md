### *Rape Myth Adherence Among Campus Law Enforcement Officers*

- Campus police subject to Title IX regulations
- Victims of sexual crimes are more likely to report to campus LEOs than munincipal LEOs - Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, and Turner
(2003)
- "*Bromley (1995) likewise noted that campus police agencies are often the first, if not the only, responders to campus crimes, including sexual assault*"
- "*Little empirical focus, however, has been placed on campus police agencies. This is unfortunate, especially given these agencies’ unique position within the university community and likelihood of responding to sexual assaults*"
- "*Multiple studies have shown that a significant proportion of police officers also ascribe to rape myths, specifically those related to the victim’s credibility and blameworthiness (Brown & King, 1998; Feild, 1978; Feldman-Summers & Palmer, 1980; Goodman-Delahunty & Graham, 2011; Page, 2007, 2010; Sleath & Bull, 2012).*"
- "*Although statistics show that the number of false reports for sexual assault is similar to those reported for other crimes, police officers are disproportionately more likely to view sexual assaults as being false (Page, 2008)*"
- Officers with specialized training typically scored lower on scales of rape myth acceptance
- Officers who scored lower on RMA scale were more likely to support campus anti-sexual assault efforts

### *Policing the Ivory Tower: Students’ Perceptions of the Legitimacy of Campus Police Officers*

- "*Although students expect the campus police to protect them from harm, they believe that officers should fulfill this function while not interfering with their lives as college students*"
- "*Students delegitimize the power of the campus police by raising questions about their status as “real” police officers and highlighting how they overreact to the wrong types of behaviors, such as underage drinking*"
- Theories on why people follow the law
  - Citizens think police are effective and that they will be caught and punished
  - People view the law as legitimate
    - Distributative Justice - Officer's services spread equally among all types of people
    - Procedural Justice - "Quality of decision-making" by officers as a whole, e.g. officers fair and respectful
      - "Sunshine and Tyler (2003) *discovered that procedural justice is the primary
factor influencing citizens’ perceptions of legitimacy*"
      - Tyler and Fagan (2008) found citizens cooperativeness depends on treatment by police in past
        - Other studies (Brunson and Weitzer 2011:428–429; see also Wada, Patten, and Candela 2010) have found cooperativeness not only affected by first-person interactions with police
-  Some articles comparing urban police to campus police: Sloan 1992; Sloan, Lanier, and Beer 2000; Wada et al. 2010
-  "*After surveying 277 undergraduates, they found that students who had experienced direct or involuntary encounters with the campus police were most likely to report critical or unfavorable attitudes toward the entire campus police department (Miller and Pan 1987; see also Hummer et al. 1998)*"
- "*Campus police officers occupy a “liminal state,” whereby they are seenby students neither as regular civilians nor as “real cops” (Wada et al. 2010:127)*"


## Williams 2016
### *The co-production of campus safety and security: a case study at the University of Georgia*

- Six themes from interviews
  - The university bubble effect
  -  The role of university officer as parent
  -  The self-perception of undergraduate university students as young, maturing adults
  -  Prevailing negative perceptions of the police based on indirect and direct enforcement encounters
  -  Perceptions of us versus them mentalities
  -  Need for more personal, positive, and informal interactions between university undergraduates and university police officers

## Shearing 1992
### *The Relation between Public and Private Policing*
- Policing refers to keeping the peace
  - Or perhaps more accurately, a *"reduction, or absence of, risk"*
- Peace takes deliberate work and structure
- The state has ultimate power over both public and private policing
  - Imposes limits on what and how private entitites can police (p 402)
- State-centered policing
  - Establishment of "new police" in London in 1829 - turn from more private to more public (p 403)
  - To start a transition to public policing, the state must be powerful enough to guarantee peace
  - Private policing has traditionally lead to a protection of assets over employees and against the public interest (see policings of early mining and railroad companies in America - Weiss 1979) (p 404-405)
    - Because of this there has been a political consciousness against extensive private policing in America, though it has waxed and waned
    - However, these private forces existed because of the vaccuum created by the lack of power by governments (p 406)
    - *"The only acceptable roles for [private police] were as guards who assisted private entities in a very limited way to protect life and property as an expression of self-defense or self-help."* (p 407)
    - Not limiting the power of these "private governments" undermined the power of public governments, but totally removing private policing would give too much power to public governments (p 407)
  - *"The understanding of policing as legitimate in its public manifestation and dangerous in its private one promoted a politics of policing as a state monopoly"* - and became the prevailing opinion across the world (p 408)
- The Emergence of a Laissez-Faire Conception
  - Starting in 1960's huge growth in numbers of private police across US and UK (p 409)
  - Research in 1970's showed this growth, contrasting the general opinion of the state's right to a monopoly of policing in 1950's and 60's
  - However, this shift in policing accompanied a shift in government opinion in support of privatization
    - *"...private policing, especially contract security, was an 'industry' providing a 'service.'"* (p 410)
    - *"RAND's report thus transformed the issue of public or private policing from a question of politics and sovereignty to be responded to in absolute terms to a matter of economics and efficiency to be addressed in terms of balance, proportion, and degree (Landes and Posner 1975; Kraakman 1986)."*
    - Private policing was decided to be mostly for "self-defense" and therefore did not undermine state's monopoly over keeping the peace
    - Seen as an "asset" as it saved public money and contributed to the economy (p 411)
    - *"Public and private police were partners in peacekeeping"* (p 412)
    - Regulations would keep private police in their own role (p 414)
  - Cunningham and Taylor proposed three responses for changes in public/private policing
    - Shearing and Stenning's criticism of the "vacuum theory" - increase in private policing was to fill hole from a lack of public policing
    - Resistance is due to public police "losing their turf"
    - Governments do not have a monopoly on policing
  - By 1980's concern that private police were not just employees but a way to get "state authority" (Stenning and Shearing 1979) (p 418)
  - Off-duty LEOs were starting to be hired by private companies
    - This seen as a win-win by Reiss (1988, pp. 15-24) as *"...off-duty officers were working at private expense to do what the state was required to do anyway"* (p 418)
  - Marxists view this shift as increased "collaboration" between governments and corporations, to help protect the interests of the elite  (Flavel 1973, p. 15; Spitzer 1987) (p 420)
- A Pluralist Perspective
  - *"Privatization, they argued, involved more than simply a change in the location of a "service" from one set of agents to another. Policing changed as its location changed"* (p 423)
  - Privatization had partly been driven by governments looking to decrease costs
    - Originally businesses had found it too costly to police on their own, but as private businesses amassed more property, it started to become more cost effective to police on their own (Spitzer and Scull 1977) (p 423)
    - This also allowed private organizations to exert more social control (Cohen 1987, pp. 376-77) (p 424)
  - Pluralist theory insists that there is a *"fundamental shift in the location of responsibility for guaranteeing and defining the peace from the state to corporate entities"* (Macauley 1986) (p 425)
    - These are interconnected hierarchical spheres of influence
    - While the state has the ultimate power over policing, it can (and has) relinquish it to private organizations (Rock 1983, p. 193; Henry 1987a).
  - There is still concern in pluralist circles that corporations have been given too much power to exert force (p 426)
- Conclusion
  - Use of force may decrease in policing, but other problems arise (p 427)
  - "*...the 'realpolitik' fear is that corporate access to information about most aspects of our lives-through the use of computer matching, "computers as informant," and the like-will "routinize the discovery of secrets" (Marx and Reichman 1987) in ways that will eliminate privacy and with it opportunities for resistance (Reiss 1984, 1987).*"
  - Response to these shifts in policing depends on the response of citizens

## Heaton et al 2016
### *The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Private Law Enforcement: Evidence from University Police*

- UCPD is the largest private police force in Chicago (Reaves 2008) (p 890)
- UCPD is a "*...highly professionalized and accredited department working in a very well-defined and discrete geographic space that extends well beyond campus and into the surrounding neighborhoods of the South Side of Chicago*"
- Areas outside UCPD's jursdiction exhibited signifcant and large increases in overall crime (55 percent) and violent crime (63 percent) (p 890)
- Crime elasticity slightly higher for UCPD than public police (Chalfin and McCrary 2013)
- Spaces that "*...are privately owned but routinely used and frequented by the public, now make up a substantial portion of the public space in urban areas*" (Stenning 2000) (p 891)
- Campus police departments are typically fully accredited, armed, and sworn, and can therefore arrest people within their jurisdiction (p 892)
  - However "*public police officers have more police academy and in-service training requirements*" (Reaves 2008)
- Paper aims to measure effectiveness of UCPD in reduction of crime (p 893)
- About UCPD
  - UCPD was formed in the 1960s and granted full police powers through an Illinois law, the Private College Campus Police Act (p 894)
  - Accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement agencies
  - Officers must go through extensive training and tests to be hired onto UCPD including "*a background investigation, written and medical exams, an oral interview, a psychological test, a drug screen and physical fitness test (POWER test), training consistent with the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board, weeks of Chicago Police Academy training, and finally the UCPD Field Training Program*" (p 895)
  - The number of full time officers increased seven percent annually from 2000 to 2010 but decreased in 2012
  - UCPD contributes to a 50% increase in per capita officers in its jursidiction compared to the average in Chicago (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2010, table 78)
  - UCPD's jursidiction has expanded over time to approximately "*6.5 square miles, containing over 65,000 residents*" (Larson 2012)
  - On average less crimes are committed in UCPD territory (p 899)
    - However once controlling for other factors, the difference becomes statistically insignificant in the short term (for violent crime as well) (p 901)
    - Including lead and lag does not make the short term difference significant
    - Looking at long term, there is a higher density of crimes right outside of the UCPD's jursdiction (p 903)
    - UCPD had a statistically significant negative impact on average crimes and violent crimes, but not property crime or violent crime in public spaces (p 904)
    - TL;DR: No evidence of short term benefit to private policing via UCPD but there is evidence for long term benefits for some types of crimes (but impossible to know for sure (p 909) )
  - Other security measures or increased awareness could also contribute to a reduction in crime, instead of due to increased numbers of LEOs (p 908)
  - Also increases in patrols would likely increase the cost of being a criminal in these areas, eventually driving them out, either to different locations or professions
  - Only 34% of violent crimes in UCPD's jurisdiction happened on campus (p 909)

# Sherman 2019
## *From Revanchism to Inclusion: Institutional Forms of Planning and Police in Hyde Park, Chicago*

- Police segregate through exclusionary **and** inclusionary practices (p 1)
- Typically researchers focus on the hot/violent side of policing (p 2)
  - "*police violently remove poor and non-white people from urban areas to extract surplus value from land*"(for Neil Smith’s work on revanchism, see Smith 1998, 2001, 2002)
  - Also focus on public policing
- Revanchist urbanism - "*as a “global urban strategy” to capitalize land through policing’s cleansing of homeless and/or non-white persons (Smith 2002)*"
  - However, non-violent racist policing exists too, non-white residents can gentrify (Freeman 2006; Patillo 2007) and police can exhibit prejudice just in responding to white calls more quickly (Howerton 2006) or keeping whites from being criminally punished (Claus, Vidal, and Harmon 2018; Mohamed and Fritsvold 2011).
  - This also includes other "racial projects" zoning  (Hirt 2013; Whittemore 2018), surveillance (Browne 2015), border enforcement (Provine and Doty 2011), and animal training (Wall 2016)
- UChicago is particularly suited for studying this
  - Long history of Jim-crow racism and segregation in Chicago (Muhammad 2011)
  - Universities play a significant role in shaping and investing in surrounding urban areas (Addie 2017; Perry and Wiewel 2005; Winling 2018)
  - Hyde Park and the surrounding area is pretty integrated, especially for Chicago (p 4)
  - CPD and UCPD both have jursdiction over campus and the surrounding areas - Hyde Park, Kenwood, Oakland, Grand Boulevard, Washington Park, Woodlawn
- Hyde Park was originally a white neighborhood, but an influx of black residents were blamed for rising crime and "primative culture" (Beadle 1965, 6) (p 5)
  - The university leveraged this fear of crime to enact policies emphasizing the policing of black bodies (p 6)
    - This included creation of the South East Chicago Commission which formed lobbying and planning efforts around this philosophy
    - The university got urban renewal authority and began by tearing down "blighted" buildings, executing "thing policing" to target the residences of people of color
    - These polices "affirmed the whiteness of Hyde Park", and largely kept white flight from occurring
- Rising crime in the 1960's and 70's caused the university to strengthen policing efforts (p 7)
  - More training and resources were invested in UCPD, and a former Chicago police captain was hired to lead the force
  - University exerted its power in local government to change policies in their favor
    - City police commissioner began deputizing UCPD
    - In 1989 new state law gave universities the power to swear in their own officers
      - UCPD now had legal jursdiction and full patroling powers in all of Cook County
    - UCPD moved into enforcing criminal statutes against community members as well as students
- Since the 90's the University has continued its urban renewal efforts
  - Received extensive funding for Hyde Park renewal from the City
  - Police have adopted more zero-tolerance policing strategies
  - Many in Hyde Park have remained critical of UCPD (#CareNotCops)
  - UCPD has stopped overwhelmingly a larger proportion of people of color according to its own reports
- Conclusion
  - "*Plans not only shape space, they also shape new police forms*"
  - "*Police not only exclude people from space, they also shape who belongs.*"

# Addtional Sources
- FBI datasets on crime
-  The Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis, U.S. Department of Education

# Brainstorming
- Readings on brown areas, stratificiation, private policing, etc
- Thinking about variables, argument about difference, and why it is important

| Descriptive | Interaction | Effect |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Traits of crimes | Traits of crimes handled by U/CPD | Equal / just policing |
| Locations of crimes | Differences in reporting of crimes handled by both | Increasing safety of uni / community |
| Demographics of victims / suspects | Differences between area inside / ouside UCPD jursidiction or comparison to other Chicago unis | |
| What does crime on campus and the surrounding area look like? | Does UCPD handle crimes differently and / or different types of crimes than CPD? | Is UCPD effective? |
