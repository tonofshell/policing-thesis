# Adviser Comments

- [x] The paper needs a conclusion

## Abstract
- [x] This is essentially what one would expect to see as the role of a campus police force. Can you say a bit more about what is notable about this finding or what nuance or insight your research contributes to our understanding of campus police forces?
  - **In reference to:** *However, while the
UCPD does collaborate collaborate extensively with CPD on more violent crimes, it is again
for crimes that impact stakeholders at the university more, such as robberies and assaults.*

## Introduction
- [x] intro repeats some of what's in U of C section
  - **In reference to:** *The UCPD patrols Hyde Park and five
surrounding neighborhoods, sharing the area with Chicago Police patrols (Sherman 2019).*
- [x] intro should be expanded - discuss the broader implications - why is it important to understand the relationship btw these two police forces and the differences in how they handle crime? how does it relate to concerns you raise about private policing and unequal policing?

## Literature review
- [ ] should follow lit review with a section that clearly lays out your research questions, which should flow directly from lit review, why they're significant questions to study, and your argument about the processes you're studying, then link that to the data you've collected and the analysis you've conducted.

### Inequality in Policing
- [ ] need better transition. what questions or concerns are raised from what we know about public policing that should shape how we think about private policing?
  - **In reference to:** end of section

### Private Policing
- [ ] again needs smoother transition
  - **In reference to:** end of section

### Campus Policing
- [ ] clarify
  - **In reference to:** *While campus police work to maintain a “good image” of the school by enforcing campus rules for students (Jacobsen 2015), they can still benefit the public, __sometimes more effectively than municipal police departments__*

## Results

### Visual Analysis
- [ ] contextualize the discussion of results by linking back to your research questions and argument. you said little about crime rates up to this point so you may also want to include more discussion in the introduction, lit review, and argument sections about why it's important to look at crime rates to understand private policing and its relationship to public policing
- [x] I'd like to see the presentation of results have a closer link to the broader themes you're exploring in the thesis, using analytically relevant categories rather than descriptive themes such as which police department responded

### Model Analysis
- [x] say more about what is substantively important about these variables
  - **In reference to:** *Crimes such as burglary, deceptive practice, and theft, areas with a higher proportion of Asians (`pop_asian`) and homeowners (`hu_owned`) were associated with a lower chance of arrest.*
- [x] what's the substantive interpretation of this finding?
  - **In reference to:** *Interestingly, crimes where the suspect was reported as being armed have a very low probability of ending in arrest, at 4%.*

## Discussion
- [x] This is one area where the tensions inherent in private policing becomes clear. What do patterns of policing around trespassing tell us about a private police force for an elite university in a predominantly black and low-income area? This is what you seem to be asking in the intro and lit review but doesn't come up much in results or discussion.
  - **In reference to:** *Furthermore, when campus policerespond to crimes of trespassing or sex crimes there is a higher likelihood of an arrest being made. Again, this seems to be indicative of differences in the communities each department polices.*
- [x] This is also an important finding about your (implicit) question about the relationship between the two police forces - you've found that even though the UCPD has this broad geographic jurisdiction, it doesn't seem to be acting much outside of the campus, which in turn raises the question about why it has such a broad jurisdiction in the first place.
  - **In reference to:** *As the UCPD does not police much outside of the Hyde Park / Kenwood area, they do not interact with as many Black community members as CPD patrols who patrol the entire area.*
- [x] This is a big claim, so I'd encourage you to do a bit more to substantiate it or to moderate it.
  - **In reference to:** *Due to this paper and previous research, it is clear the university only cares about safety as it affects their bottom line.*
